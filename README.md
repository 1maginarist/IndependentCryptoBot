# IndependentCryptoBot
This is a test version of my pet project to create a cryptobot for cryptocurrency analytics. It will be developed later. Please contribute with ideas of how to make it better and any other suggestions for adding functionality.  
  
Bot is hosted on VPS via system service and running 24/7 so you can test it: https://t.me/Independent_crypto_bot  
  
Commands:  
-> /start to restart bot  
-> /help to get info about general commands available  
-> /menu to enter a main menu with limited functionality
